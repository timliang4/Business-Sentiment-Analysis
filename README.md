>A RESTful API for performing sentiment analysis on recent business reviews, with a companion React app

## Motivation

The online ratings and reviews for businesses are often outdated and, as a result, inaccurate.

The Business Sentiment Analysis RESTful API performs sentiment analysis on the most recent reviews of any business supported by the [Google Places API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/overview), providing users with up-to-date and accurate information about the business.

## Code

>The API and app are not publicly deployed because the Google Places API is not free.

The ```business-sentiment-analysis``` folder contains a Maven project with the Spring Boot REST API code. It has a jar executable you can run on your local machine.

The ```app``` folder contains the React front-end application. It provides functionality for creating, reading, updating, and deleting sentiment analysis entries for businesses.
