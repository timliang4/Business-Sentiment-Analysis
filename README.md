# Business Sentiment Analysis

>A RESTful API for performing sentiment analysis on recent business reviews, with a companion React app

## Motivation

The online ratings and reviews for businesses are often outdated and, as a result, inaccurate.

The Business Sentiment Analysis RESTful API performs sentiment analysis on the most recent reviews of any business supported by the [Google Places API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/overview), providing users with up-to-date and accurate information about the business.

## Example

>The API and app are not publicly deployed because the Google Places API is not free and neither is deploying apps.
