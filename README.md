# Business Sentiment Analysis

>A RESTful API for performing sentiment analysis on recent business reviews, with a companion React app

## Motivation

The online ratings and reviews for businesses are often outdated and, as a result, inaccurate.

The Business Sentiment Analysis RESTful API performs sentiment analysis on the most recent reviews of any business supported by the [Google Places API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/overview), providing users with up-to-date and accurate information about the business.

## Example

>The API and app are not publicly deployed because the Google Places API is not free.

Analyzing the sentiment for [Aja Asian Cuisine](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Aja+Asian+Cuisine/@40.420953,-74.655754,779m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x89c3e89a69512f01:0x9014df1b2e11661c!8m2!3d40.420953!4d-74.655754!16s%2Fg%2F11c60mlz_1?entry=ttu).
